**The quick TL;DR of this userscript is that it adds a [button](https://i.imgur.com/KhQjZ3j.png) that manually starts the userscript, checks if the bet amount is 100, auto clicks the [lever](https://materialize.is/static/common/casino/leverUp.png) until you either reload the page or get a jackpot of 10,000 credits or more which will unlock the badge <img src="https://i.ibb.co/GQTcm7t/slotmachine.png" width="20" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 5px;" alt="Slot Machine Badge" title="Awarded for winning 10,000 or more in the slots in one spin"> and stop the userscript.**

[materialize](https://materialize.is/bonus.php?action=slot) has a slot machine for users to Waste Their Creditsâ„¢ with a earnable user badge called "Slot Machine Badge", I know, super creative name lol. Anyways, you can manually click the slot machine and run it as many times as needed to obtain the 10,000 or more credits in one spin, which is what unlocks the badge. It took me about [2088](https://i.imgur.com/grNoj0k.png) spins to get the badge, and that was mostly manually. If you stumble upon this Github page either through the tracker itself (from my shameless self promotion) or from Google or whatever, you can automate obtaining this badge (if you have enough credits) through my userscript.
